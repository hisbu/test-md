# Policies

## Write a policy

The first step to create gather policy requirements.

An **admin** user must be able to:

- Read system health check
- Create and manage ACL policies broadly across Vault
- Enable and manage authentication methods broadly across Vault
- Manage the Key-Value secrets engine enabled at `secret/` path

Define the admin policy in the file named `admin-policy.hcl`.

```yaml
$ tee admin-policy.hcl <<EOF
# Read system health check
path "sys/health"
{  
	capabilities = ["read", "sudo"]
}

# Create and manage ACL policies broadly across Vault

# List existing policies
path "sys/policies/acl"
{  
	capabilities = ["list"]
}

# Create and manage ACL policies
path "sys/policies/acl/*"
{  
	capabilities = ["create", "read", "update", "delete", "list", "sudo"]
}

# Enable and manage authentication methods broadly across Vault
# Manage auth methods broadly across Vault
path "auth/*"
{  
	capabilities = ["create", "read", "update", "delete", "list", "sudo"]
}

# Create, update, and delete auth methods
path "sys/auth/*"
{  
	capabilities = ["create", "update", "delete", "sudo"]
}

# List auth methods
path "sys/auth"
{  
	capabilities = ["read"]
}

# Enable and manage the key/value secrets engine at `secret/` path

# List, create, update, and delete key/value secrets
path "secret/*"
{  
	capabilities = ["create", "read", "update", "delete", "list", "sudo"]
}

# Manage secrets engines
path "sys/mounts/*"
{  
	capabilities = ["create", "read", "update", "delete", "list", "sudo"]
}

# List existing secrets engines.
path "sys/mounts"
{  
	capabilities = ["read"]
}
EOF
```

A policy define one or more paths and a list of permitted [capabilities](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/policies.html#capabilities). Most of these capabilities map to the HTTP verbs supported by the Vault API.

The **sudo** capability allows access to paths that are root-protected (Refer to the [Root protected endpoints](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/vault/policies?in=vault/policies#root-protected-api-endpoints) section). 

The **deny** capability disables access to the path. When combined with other capabilities it always precedence.

### **Create a policy**

Create an *admin* policy

**CLI Command**

Create a policy named `admin` with the policy defined in `admin-policy.hcl`.

```bash
vault policy write admin admin-policy.hcl
Success! Uploaded policy: admin
```

Read the `admin` policy.

```bash
vault policy read admin
```

### Web UI

1. Open a web browser and launch the Vault UI (e.g. [http://127.0.0.1:8200/ui](http://127.0.0.1:8200/ui)) and enter `root` in the **Token** text field.
