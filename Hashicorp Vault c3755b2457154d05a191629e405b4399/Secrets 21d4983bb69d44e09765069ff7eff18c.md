### Policy requirements

To perform all tasks demonstrated in this tutorial, your policy must include the following permissions:

```bash
# Enable key/value secrets engine at the kv-v1 path
path "sys/mounts/kv-v1" 
{  
	capabilities = [ "update" ]
}

# To list the available secrets engines
path "sys/mounts" 
{  
	capabilities = [ "read" ]
}

# Write and manage secrets in key/value secrets engine
path "kv-v1/*" 
{  
	capabilities = [ "create", "read", "update", "delete", "list" ]
}

# Create policies to permit apps to read secrets
path "sys/policies/acl/*" 
{  
	capabilities = [ "create", "read", "update", "delete", "list" ]
}

# Create tokens for verification & test
